#### The Beginning of Terin Aqus
Long ago, before the annals of history were etched, before Elves, Orcs, or any other creature walked or swam upon this world, it was nothing more than a vast, barren sea. Unknown, ancient powers beyond our comprehension discovered this place that we now call [Terin Aqus](#location-index) and resolved to make it whole, like other realms they had touched. They descended upon it and bestowed two offspring: celestial beings with the powers to shape it and bring forth life.

The first was [Terin](#character-index), a Goddess with dominion over the earth.

The second was [Aegeon](#character-index), a God with mastery over the sea.

These were the gods of Origin.

#### The Age of Balance
At first, the two divine beings coexisted in perfect harmony. Terin executed her purpose by raising great lands from the sea, forming continents and mountains to house life. Together, she and Aegeon maintained balance, creating a world half land and half sea, where peace reigned supreme.

To fulfill this land’s potential, however, they required more than mere elements. To achieve this, they each spawned a sibling. Terin brought forth a sister, [Merina](#character-index), a Goddess of earthly beings, with the powers of life, nature, and light. Aegeon, too, needed a companion to uphold the balance they had achieved, and thus was born [Helatos](#character-index), a God of the sea creatures, with dominion over the dark, death, and the arcane. These younger siblings became known as the gods of Eternal Balance, locked in an ever-revolving ebb and flow to maintain the scales.

Merina bestowed great life upon the land. First, she birthed the forests and fields to feed and sustain. Then, she birthed the beasts, great and small, each creature created with balance so that as each would take from the realm, so too would it give back. Then, she created the Humans and Dwarves, sentient beings to govern the land in her stead; one above the land, and one below. From these two races, all others took shape: the oldest being the Orcs, then the Gnomes, then the Elves, and so forth. Every iteration was meant to contest and balance the others. Finally, she bore two celestial protectors, The Great Eagles and the Dragons. Though not gods, these beings were given the power to watch over the lesser beings and maintain order.

Helatos, on the other hand, did similarly with the flora and fauna of the sea. Instead of intellect, he endowed his creatures with strength and arcane power. These creatures were intended to keep the humanoids on land where their dominion lay. Not much is known about these creatures, but two dominant species were formed below: the Cephalopods, mysterious tentacled beings of curious intelligence and dark magic, and the Cetacea, agile and friendly sea creatures with arcane abilities. Few have ever seen beings of either species.

This era before history is known as the Age of Balance.

#### The Age of the Maelstrom
Beyond this, not much is known or recorded about the history of Terin Aqus until the Age of the Maelstrom. The Humans were the only true record keepers of this era, having been the only people to form civilizations for thousands of years. The Orcs were savages at the time, unorganized and nomadic. The Dwarves, a protective and paranoid lot, hid underground, delving into the depths instead of the surface.

The Elves, the youngest race, were said to be born from humans who communed most closely with Merina. Wanting to create a race more in her likeness, she impregnated a select few with her essence. It is speculated that she had become wary of the humans and their arrogance and ambition, said to have formed giant lost kingdoms across the lands. It is also widely accepted that they caused the Age of the Maelstrom to begin.

No one knows what the humans did exactly, but somehow they incurred the wrath of Aegeon. Since creation, the twin gods of Origin had been mostly dormant. Something angered Aegeon, corrupted him, and turned him wildly aggressive toward the beings of the land. During this age, he became known as the God of Chaos. A great war broke out between the celestial beings. Dragons fought Cetacea, Eagles fought Cephalopods, and the Humans fought. This upset the balance. The humans had grown powerful in many ways: military and strategic prowess, naval command, and arcane abilities. For a while, it seemed like the Humans had the power to turn the balance and win this war. But then… Chaos. The pact of Aegeon and Terin was broken. Aegeon emerged unto the primal realm from a deep realm of darkness he had made in the outskirts of the sea. With his hand, he fought the humans himself. A mere swipe of Aegeon’s hand could drown entire armies and navies. Then, he turned his attention to the lands themselves. The dragons, who had been fighting alongside the humans, tried to stop him, but they were no match and were nearly wiped out. He went to the lands of the humans and annihilated them, crushing great empires with waves upon waves of not just water, but something else: a wave of pure evil, sinking some lands and corrupting others.

The Eagles, meanwhile, sought the help of the other gods. Helatos could offer no assistance. They were fighting his creatures, and he, a being of balance, could not intervene. Moreover, Helatos, the usher of the afterlife, needed to devote all his power to sorting and ordering the life essences of the rapidly dying creatures, lest they evaporate back into the beyond.

Merina, also a being of balance, could only lend the Eagles her powers of healing. She, too, had a mission dedicated to saving as many creatures as possible who had not yet passed into the great beyond.

Finally, they communed with Terin, who had not made her presence felt in a millennia. Led by an Eagle named Aquillus, they searched the skies, across the lands, and over the seas. To no avail. The legends had told them that Terin slept deep at the core of the world, below the center of the sea, in between the ring of islands that were known to be the first lands. The Eagles, however, could not survive underwater and were created with that limitation in mind. Hopeless, they left to plead with Aegeon or at least to witness the end of the world. All except Aquillus. Frustrated and driven by purpose, he took a great dive, and with some divinity behind him, dove into the chaotic waters. He dove deep, very deep. But not deep enough. Light flooded around him, emanating from his body, but he could not see any signs of a god. He swam as best as he could, deeper and deeper, as his essence faded slowly with each push. He felt himself dying and knew that if he did not turn back, there was no chance he would survive. And yet, he pushed. Deeper and deeper. And then… his light flickered out. He drifted, lifeless, in the darkest depths. Hope was lost.

#### The Sacrifice of Aquillus
Suddenly, as his essence lifted from his body, Helatos responded to the call of such a powerful creature passing. He pondered the transgressing events and the end of the balance he held so dear. Though he lacked the power to grant life, he could hold the essence where it stayed. He looked down and saw there, dormant, Terin in a deep slumber of ages. The poor eagle had gotten so close. So he broke his bond with Aegeon and touched Terin. She, a much more massive god than he, awoke, her eyes beaming. As the Goddess of creation, she needed no update. She arose and stood from the sea. She called to her brother, asking him to see reason and restore this world to the balance they had once designed.

“Order is folly. Disorder is the true Nature of the Universe,” Aegeon declared.

He would not be reasoned with. And so a great battle waged between Terin and Aegeon. Entire lands crumbled and shattered in the wake of their struggle. Terin expended all her power, but Aegeon, having broken his pact of balance, had drawn an immense amount of power from somewhere new, somewhere beyond this plane. Even she could not stop him… not alone. She reached into the sea and grasped the eagle who had sought her, who had shown great strength and courage, and who had given so selflessly to defend this world. She raised him to the heavens, and the powers that made Aegeon and Terin took him. He returned as a deity of pure good. The balance had already been upset, and Aegeon had found a source of power beyond the celestial, so they must combat him somehow.

Aquillus’s new form was that of a giant winged being of light. He joined

 Terin, and together they were able to fend off Aegeon’s powers. Forcing him deep under the sea, they bound his powerful hands and sealed him with a cage of light, earth, and pure celestial essence. The battle, however, weakened and wounded Terin so massively that, to survive, she needed to return to the celestial realm. This left the restoration of the world to the new trinity of gods: Aquillus, God of Protection and Good; Merina, Goddess of Life and Nature; and Helatos, God of Death and Arcane. There were no more elemental gods who could raise lands or form the world. This broken land that was left was all they had to work with.

#### Summary
At the beginning of time, two gods were formed by the celestial beyond, named Terin and Aegeon. They built the land and curbed the wild sea, respectively. They both begat two lesser siblings, Merina, Goddess of Life and Nature, and Helatos, God of Death and Arcane. One of the land, one of the sea. Known as the twin gods of balance, Merina formed all the land creatures, and Helatos the sea creatures. The humans are said to have gotten too powerful and arrogant, and Aegeon, corrupted by a power not of the celestial, arose and wiped out the humans and most of the dragons. Terin was awoken by the selfless sacrifice of the leader of the eagles, Aquillus, and first reasoned with, and then fought Aegeon. Aegeon was too powerful from the powers he had gained from this dark, evil source. Desperate, Terin rose this selfless eagle to the celestial beyond and he returned a god and fought off Aegeon, imprisoning him and binding his powerful hands. Terin, too weak to survive here, returned to the celestial plane. Aquillus, Merina, and Helatos became the new trinity to restore and maintain the world that had been greatly shattered.

Terin, too weak to survive here, returned to the celestial plane. Aquillus, Merina, and Helatos became the new trinity to restore and maintain the world that had been greatly shattered.

The Beginning of Terin Aqus
Long ago, before the annals of history were etched, before Elves, Orcs, or any other creature walked or swam upon this world, it was nothing more than a vast, barren sea. Unknown, ancient powers beyond our comprehension discovered this place that we now call Terin Aqus and resolved to make it whole, like other realms they had touched. They descended upon it and bestowed two offspring: celestial beings with the powers to shape it and bring forth life.

The first was Terin, a Goddess with dominion over the earth.

The second was Aegeon, a God with mastery over the sea.

These were the gods of Origin.

Back to Index
The Age of Balance
At first, the two divine beings coexisted in perfect harmony. Terin executed her purpose by raising great lands from the sea, forming continents and mountains to house life. Together, she and Aegeon maintained balance, creating a world half land and half sea, where peace reigned supreme.

To fulfill this land’s potential, however, they required more than mere elements. To achieve this, they each spawned a sibling. Terin brought forth a sister, Merina, a Goddess of earthly beings, with the powers of life, nature, and light. Aegeon, too, needed a companion to uphold the balance they had achieved, and thus was born Helatos, a God of the sea creatures, with dominion over the dark, death, and the arcane. These younger siblings became known as the gods of Eternal Balance, locked in an ever-revolving ebb and flow to maintain the scales.

Merina bestowed great life upon the land. First, she birthed the forests and fields to feed and sustain. Then, she birthed the beasts, great and small, each creature created with balance so that as each would take from the realm, so too would it give back. Then, she created the Humans and Dwarves, sentient beings to govern the land in her stead; one above the land, and one below. From these two races, all others took shape: the oldest being the Orcs, then the Gnomes, then the Elves, and so forth. Every iteration was meant to contest and balance the others. Finally, she bore two celestial protectors, The Great Eagles and the Dragons. Though not gods, these beings were given the power to watch over the lesser beings and maintain order.

Helatos, on the other hand, did similarly with the flora and fauna of the sea. Instead of intellect, he endowed his creatures with strength and arcane power. These creatures were intended to keep the humanoids on land where their dominion lay. Not much is known about these creatures, but two dominant species were formed below: the Cephalopods, mysterious tentacled beings of curious intelligence and dark magic, and the Cetacea, agile and friendly sea creatures with arcane abilities. Few have ever seen beings of either species.

This era before history is known as the Age of Balance.

Back to Index
The Age of the Maelstrom
Beyond this, not much is known or recorded about the history of Terin Aqus until the Age of the Maelstrom. The Humans were the only true record keepers of this era, having been the only people to form civilizations for thousands of years. The Orcs were savages at the time, unorganized and nomadic. The Dwarves, a protective and paranoid lot, hid underground, delving into the depths instead of the surface.

The Elves, the youngest race, were said to be born from humans who communed most closely with Merina. Wanting to create a race more in her likeness, she impregnated a select few with her essence. It is speculated that she had become wary of the humans and their arrogance and ambition, said to have formed giant lost kingdoms across the lands. It is also widely accepted that they caused the Age of the Maelstrom to begin.

No one knows what the humans did exactly, but somehow they incurred the wrath of Aegeon. Since creation, the twin gods of Origin had been mostly dormant. Something angered Aegeon, corrupted him, and turned him wildly aggressive toward the beings of the land. During this age, he became known as the God of Chaos. A great war broke out between the celestial beings. Dragons fought Cetacea, Eagles fought Cephalopods, and the Humans fought. This upset the balance. The humans had grown powerful in many ways: military and strategic prowess, naval command, and arcane abilities. For a while, it seemed like the Humans had the power to turn the balance and win this war. But then… Chaos. The pact of Aegeon and Terin was broken. Aegeon emerged unto the primal realm from a deep realm of darkness he had made in the outskirts of the sea. With his hand, he fought the humans himself. A mere swipe of Aegeon’s hand could drown entire armies and navies. Then, he turned his attention to the lands themselves. The dragons, who had been fighting alongside the humans, tried to stop him, but they were no match and were nearly wiped out. He went to the lands of the humans and annihilated them, crushing great empires with waves upon waves of not just water, but something else: a wave of pure evil, sinking some lands and corrupting others.

The Eagles, meanwhile, sought the help of the other gods. Helatos could offer no assistance. They were fighting his creatures, and he, a being of balance, could not intervene. Moreover, Helatos, the usher of the afterlife, needed to devote all his power to sorting and ordering the life essences of the rapidly dying creatures, lest they evaporate back into the beyond.

Merina, also a being of balance, could only lend the Eagles her powers of healing. She, too, had a mission dedicated to saving as many creatures as possible who had not yet passed into the great beyond.

Finally, they communed with Terin, who had not made her presence felt in a millennia. Led by an Eagle named Aquillus, they searched the skies, across the lands, and over the seas. To no avail. The legends had told them that Terin slept deep at the core of the world, below the center of the sea, in between the ring of islands that were known to be the first lands. The Eagles, however, could not survive underwater and were created with that limitation in mind. Hopeless, they left to plead with Aegeon or at least to witness the end of the world. All except Aquillus. Frustrated and driven by purpose, he took a great dive, and with some divinity behind him, dove into the chaotic waters. He dove deep, very deep. But not deep enough. Light flooded around him, emanating from his body, but he could not see any signs of a god. He swam as best as he could, deeper and deeper, as his essence faded slowly with each push. He felt himself dying and knew that if he did not turn back, there was no chance he would survive. And yet, he pushed. Deeper and deeper. And then… his light flickered out. He drifted, lifeless, in the darkest depths. Hope was lost.

The Sacrifice of Aquillus
Suddenly, as his essence lifted from his body, Helatos responded to the call of such a powerful creature passing. He pondered the transgressing events and the end of the balance he held so dear. Though he lacked the power to grant life, he could hold the essence where it stayed. He looked down and saw there, dormant, Terin in a deep slumber of ages. The poor eagle had gotten so close. So he broke his bond with Aegeon and touched Terin. She, a much more massive god than he, awoke, her eyes beaming. As the Goddess of creation, she needed no update. She arose and stood from the sea. She called to her brother, asking him to see reason and restore this world to the balance they had once designed.

“Order is folly. Disorder is the true Nature of the Universe,” Aegeon declared.

He would not be reasoned with. And so a great battle waged between Terin and Aegeon. Entire lands crumbled and shattered in the wake of their struggle. Terin expended all her power, but Aegeon, having broken his pact of balance, had drawn an immense amount of power from somewhere new, somewhere beyond this plane. Even she could not stop him… not alone. She reached into the sea and grasped the eagle who had sought her, who had shown great strength and courage, and who had given so selflessly to defend this world. She raised him to the heavens, and the powers that made Aegeon and Terin took him. He returned as a deity of pure good. The balance had already been upset, and Aegeon had found a source of power beyond the celestial, so they must combat him somehow.

Aquillus’s new form was that of a giant winged being of light. He joined

Terin, and together they were able to fend off Aegeon’s powers. Forcing him deep under the sea, they bound his powerful hands and sealed him with a cage of light, earth, and pure celestial essence. The battle, however, weakened and wounded Terin so massively that, to survive, she needed to return to the celestial realm. This left the restoration of the world to the new trinity of gods: Aquillus, God of Protection and Good; Merina, Goddess of Life and Nature; and Helatos, God of Death and Arcane. There were no more elemental gods who could raise lands or form the world. This broken land that was left was all they had to work with.

Summary
At the beginning of time, two gods were formed by the celestial beyond, named Terin and Aegeon. They built the land and curbed the wild sea, respectively. They both begat two lesser siblings, Merina, Goddess of Life and Nature, and Helatos, God of Death and Arcane. One of the land, one of the sea. Known as the twin gods of balance, Merina formed all the land creatures, and Helatos the sea creatures. The humans are said to have gotten too powerful and arrogant, and Aegeon, corrupted by a power not of the celestial, arose and wiped out the humans and most of the dragons. Terin was awoken by the selfless sacrifice of the leader of the eagles, Aquillus, and first reasoned with, and then fought Aegeon. Aegeon was too powerful from the powers he had gained from this dark, evil source. Desperate, Terin rose this selfless eagle to the celestial beyond and he returned a god and fought off Aegeon, imprisoning him and binding his powerful hands. Terin, too weak to survive here, returned to the celestial plane. Aquillus, Merina, and Helatos became the new trinity to restore and maintain the world that had been greatly shattered.

At the beginning of time, two gods were formed by the celestial beyond, named Terin and Aegeon. They built the land and curbed the wild sea, respectively. They both begat two lesser siblings, Merina, Goddess of Life and Nature, and Helatos, God of Death and Arcane. One of the land, one of the sea. Known as the twin gods of balance, Merina formed all the land creatures, and Helatos the sea creatures. The humans are said to have gotten too powerful and arrogant, and Aegeon, corrupted by a power not of the celestial, arose and wiped out the humans and most of the dragons. Terin was awoken by the selfless sacrifice of the leader of the eagles, Aquillus, and first reasoned with, and then fought Aegeon. Aegeon was too powerful from the powers he had gained from this dark, evil source. Desperate, Terin rose this selfless eagle to the celestial beyond and he returned a god and fought off Aegeon, imprisoning him and binding his powerful hands. Terin, too weak to survive here, returned to the celestial plane. Aquillus, Merina, and Helatos became the new trinity to restore and maintain the world that had been greatly shattered.
